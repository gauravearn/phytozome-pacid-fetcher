# phytozome-pacid-fetcher
this function takes ids file with the gene of interest and the phytozome gff files and will fetch the pacid for the genes of interest. much faster than the online version as it uses a dataframe approach. 

I have added two additional functions which will help you process the raw files from the phytozome for the pacid analysis.
